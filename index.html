    <h1>A step by step walkthrough of your first HTML webpage</h1>
    <img src="/images/step.png" alt="A step by step walkthrough of your first HTML webpage image">
    <p>HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language Basically, its the “code” behind every webpage — even this one. If
        you're
        just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML,
        without styling, can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames — but it is
        handy as
        it helps you structure the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add
        style to your HTML.</p>
    <img src="/images/code" alt="code image" width="700px">
    <p>However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes to full-fledged web development. Various
        tools
        easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process — but if you want to be in
        fall control of your web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.

        Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML building blocks that'll help you get up and running.
        Reading
        this, you'll be able to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your
        own good!</p>
    <h3>Step one - TAGS</h3>
    <img src="/images/codeSymbol.png" alt="Tag image" width="750px" height="400px">
    <p>Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper
        to any
        item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content
        enclosed by them.

        Let's look at two types of tags:

    <ol>
        1.&#60;tag-example-1>I need a closign tag &#60;<tag-example-1><br>
            2. &#60;tag-example-2 />I don't need a cloding tag.
    </ol>

    In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one is called the opening tag and
    the
    second one is called the closing tag. Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag.
    Very
    commonly used examples of such tags are &#60;html>,

    &#60;head>,

    &#60;body>, &#60;strong>, etc.</p>

    <p> second example tags about loner tags — as in, they dont need a closing tag to function.
        Although
        it's not required, these type of tags are often written as &#60;tag> to make the debugging of code
        easier.
        Common examples of such tags are &#60;hri> — used for horizontal line, &#60;br /> — to break the
        line, etc.</p>
    <h3>Step Two - HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your document</h3>
    <img src="/images/neck.jpg" alt="head and body tag tattoo in the neck" width="600px">
    <p>These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the significant parts of your HTML code.
        +

    <ul>
        <li>
            &#60;BODY>&#60;/BODY> is placed below your
            &#60;HEAD> tag, and everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this tag. Text,
            images,
            links, and pretty much anything you can see in
            your browser live inside this tag.</li>
        <li>&#60;HTML>&#60;/HTML> wraps your entire code. Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside
            these
            tags.</li>
        <li>&#60;HEAD>&#60;/HEAD> includes things like title, styles, and scripts. Head is usually present at the top
            (hah!),
            just
            inside the &#60;/HTML> tag.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Step three — A few tags thatll make your page pretty</h3>
    <p>Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document, let's proceed with the things that will go inside
        your

        &#60;BODY> tag and do some magic! <br>
        Some basic text formatting tags:
    <ul>
        <li>&#60;b> &#60;/b> makes your text look bold</li>
        <li>&#60;i> &#60;/i> you write in cursive</li>
        <li>&#60;u> &#60;/u> underlines what you just wrote</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For example, this piece of code</p>
    <hr>
    &#60;html> <br>

    &#60;head> &#60;/head> <br> <br>

    &#60;body> <br> <br>
    &#60;i> I am italics! &#60;/i> <br />
    &#60;b> I am bold! &#60;/b> <br />
    &#60;u> And me, well, I'm underlined! &#60;/u> <br />

    &#60;/body> <br>

    &#60;html>
    <hr>
    </hr>
    <p>Should produce something like this on your browser: Dont fret too much about the &#60;br>. Its just for breaking
        the line
        so that you can start from the next line. Enter key does little when it comes to changing
        lines in your HTML document.</p>
